# Public Code for Section 301 and Politics: Analysis of Tariff Exclusions

As of current as the project is still in progress, we are only sharing code written by Joseph M. Westenberg to scrape information from the tables on USTR's website. This code can be found in ustr_portal_scrape.R

This data can be combined with data from Mercatus center to have a dataset for exclusion requests for all 4 lists. Mercatus' data can be found here: [https://www.quantgov.org/tariffs#tariff-data](https://www.quantgov.org/tariffs#tariff-data)
